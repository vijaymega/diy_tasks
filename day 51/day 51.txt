1. What is node js ?
    
      ==>Node.js is a javascript runtime built on chrome's V8 engine,to take
         the javascript codes and compile them in time to machine codes,to
         build fast and scalable network applications.

      ==>Node.js solves all this problem by collecting all these requests in 
         a single thread via events,so when the first event is being processed. 
         It does not wait for the response but simply contiues with the next
         request.Thus, it eliminates the waiting time and cost.

      ==>NPM ia an online respository that gives up open-source packages to solve
         common problems by installing those packages instead of recreting it.
